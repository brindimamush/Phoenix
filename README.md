## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Organized into reusable React components for maintainability.
- **TypeScript:** Enhanced code quality and maintainability with static type checking.
- **Vite:** Fast development server and optimized production builds.
- **Interactive UI:** Includes a toggle switch and basic balance management.
- **Custom Styling:** Utilizes a single CSS file for styling, directly adapted from the original HTML/CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Vite:** A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the web content.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Vite React TypeScript structure with a dedicated `components` directory:

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

    (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub details.)

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This will start the Vite development server, usually at http://localhost:5173. Open your browser and navigate to this URL to see the application.

Building for Production
To create an optimized production build of the application:

Bash

npm run build
# or
yarn build
This command will compile the TypeScript and JSX, minify the code, and create a dist folder (or build if you were using Create React App) in the root of your project. The contents of this folder are the static files ready for deployment.
```
